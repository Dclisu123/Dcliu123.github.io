## Background 

I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Wm Michael Barnes ’64 Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering](https://engineering.tamu.edu/industrial/index.html) at Texas A&M University, majoring in operations research and I am currently working under the supervision of [Dr. Hrayer Aprahamian](https://engineering.tamu.edu/industrial/profiles/aprahamian-hrayer.html).

## Research Interests
My research is situated at the intersections of **operations research** methodologies, **healthcare systems**, and public **policy decision-making**. Specifically, I focus on developing effective public health disease mitigation strategies that account for crucial population and disease characteristics. The current research field faces many challenges, such as the lack of integration of individual-level, subject-specific information (including risk and contact data), dynamically changing behaviors, and fairness considerations within an optimization framework. In my research, I explore various disease mitigation strategies that incorporate these factors and leverage structural properties to design strategies that are both efficient and equitable.
